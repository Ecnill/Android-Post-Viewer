It comes in sealed plastic bags as it contains a lot of water and quite soft. I understand that in other locations it's name might be \"queso fresco\". I've found here some photos of the product and it's varieties <a href=\"http://www.quesoslatinos.com/catalogo-online\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, if this variety cheese can be considered raw food.</p>\n\n<p>I think that a good definition of raw food cheese is that it's made of unpasteurized milk and it's not heated above or 40Â°C</p>\n"},{"tags":["cleaning","pot","stainless-steel"],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":55199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef26490ce64f932af9ae6e9e554b036?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"G_H","link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/55199/g-h"},"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"answer_count":0,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1489181839,"creation_date":1489176352,"last_edit_date":1489181839,"question_id":79038,"link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/79038/how-can-i-remove-sticky-residue-from-a-pot-i-boiled-salsify-in","title":"How can I remove sticky residue from a pot I boiled salsify in?","body":"<p>Yesterday I made black salsify. I got the salsify fresh and peeled it myself. Knowing what a hassle that is, I rinced and scrubbed it, put on disposable gloves and peeled in my sink, which afterwards I scrubbed down with a cleaning agent. I put the salsify in water with vinegar to avoid discoloration.</p>\n\n<p>I peeled the salsify very thin, however. There were a few small spots of black peel left here and there, but since I was cooking for myself I didn't mind if it looked less than perfect. However, this might have left a bit of the sap on there and after cooking them, it has settled in my stainless steel pot on the sides, at where the water level was. The residue is sticky and extremely resilient.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried scrubbing with a brush and detergent to no avail. After that I put in a mixture of water and vinegar hoping that would soak it loose, but without much success. Just now I took a scrubbing sponge to it with some kitchen cleaner, but no dice. I guess with continued use it might eventually start disappearing, but it's unsightly and probably not too hygienic. Any advice on what could successfully remove this rubbery substance?</p>\n"},{"tags":["onions"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":55195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba033a702304b932dce7c4550ac028d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mack","link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/55195/mack"},"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1489170331,"creation_date":1489170331,"question_id":79036,"link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/79036/too-much-onion","title":"Too much onion!","body":"<p>I made the mistake of putting all of the chopped onion in my macaroni salad before testing it.
