I avoid salamis as their (saturated) fat content is conspicuous and alarming, but even the better ones, such as capocollo, are still filled with chemicals, with MSG, sodium erythorbate, and sodium phosphate present in those claiming to be superior because they contain no wheat.</p>\n\n<p>The next best option is to prepare my own meat, slice it as thinly as I can, and use that. Unfortunately it'll be necessary to freeze and thaw, since otherwise the time investment would be prohibitive.</p>\n\n<p>What is a class of homemade cold cuts that can replace store bought ones? I can think of roasting (slow cooking) lamb, pork, or chicken, suitably spiced with garlic, oil, and mustard, but the resulting flavor does not quite compete with the deli section.

I want to stain the large curd with green on the outside so that it has a marbled look after pressing. What could I use to soak the curd in and get the best results? Spinach juice was suggested but I'm wondering if their are better options? I saw another post here with some suggestions but it didn't really have any good answers specifically about green. It's going to have to be a very hardy, dark green to have any affect on the curd.</p>\n"},{"tags":["cooking-time"],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":55185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92bfcd93cbebb551ef49aebffa48507d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Team Toronto","link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/users/55185/team-toronto"},"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1489167610,"creation_date":1489145428,"last_edit_date":1489158449,"question_id":79024,"link":"http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/79024/messed-up-brisket","title":"Messed up brisket","body":"<p>First brisket ever and I don't know what went amiss.
